I will then group the users into one of 4 groups: overnight, morning, afternoon, and evening gamers. If the user gamed more than once, the mode will be used to categorize the user. Next, I will train a regression model to predict if the \"kind\" of gamer (overnight, morning, afternoon, or evening) can predict the total duration of gaming for a user. The results of this will allow for the research team to target certain hours of the day to gather players that contribute a larger amount of data.</p>"
