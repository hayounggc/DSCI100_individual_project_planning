If the time was separate, for example, you could analyze the time at which the most users start to game.</li>\n",

Due to the small unit, it is difficult to read the data and make meaningful inferences. For example, the mean and median of the original start and end time is 1.719e+12 miliseconds. Therefore, changing to a larger unit will help use the data and make meaningful inferences during data analysis.</li>\n",
